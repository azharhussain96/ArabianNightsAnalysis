Know, O King of the age, that what hath happened to me is more wonderful
    than the events which have happened to all the others. Before I met the
    humpback, I was, early in the morning, at an entertainment given to
    certain tradesmen of my acquaintance, consisting of tailors and
    linen-drapers and carpenters and others; and when the sun had risen, the
    repast was brought for us to eat; and lo, the master of the house came
    in to us, accompanied by a strange and handsome young man, of the
    inhabitants of Baghdád. He was attired in clothes of the handsomest
    description, and was a most comely person, except that he was lame; and
    as soon as he had entered and saluted us, we rose to him; but when he
    was about to seat himself, he observed among us a man who was a barber,
    whereupon he refused to sit down, and desired to depart from us. We and
    the master of the house, however, prevented him, and urged him to seat
    himself; and the host conjured him, saying, What is the reason of thy
    entering, and then immediately departing?--By Allah, O my master,
    replied he, offer me no opposition; for the cause of my departure is
    this barber, who is sitting with you. And when the host heard this, he
    was exceedingly surprised, and said, How is it that the heart of this
    young man, who is from Baghdád, is troubled by the presence of this
    barber? We then looked towards him, and said, Relate to us the cause of
    thy displeasure against this barber; and the young man replied, O
    company, a surprising adventure happened to me with this barber in
    Baghdád, my city; and he was the cause of my lameness, and of the
    breaking of my leg; and I have sworn that I will not sit in any place
    where he is present, nor dwell in any town where he resides: I quitted
    Baghdád and took up my abode in this city, and I will not pass the next
    night without departing from it.--Upon this, we said to him, We conjure
    thee, by Allah, to relate to us thy adventure with him.--And the
    countenance of the barber turned pale when he heard us make this
    request. The young man then said,--

    Know, O good people, that my father was one of the chief merchants of
    Baghdád; and God (whose name be exalted!) blessed him with no son but
    myself; and when I grew up, and had attained to manhood, my father was
    admitted to the mercy of God, leaving me wealth and servants and other
    dependants; whereupon I began to attire myself in clothes of the
    handsomest description, and to feed upon the most delicious meats. Now
    God (whose perfection be extolled!) made me to be a hater of women; and
    so I continued, until, one day, I was walking through the streets of
    Baghdád, when a party of them stopped my way: I therefore fled from
    them, and, entering a by-street which was not a thoroughfare, I reclined
    upon a maṣṭabah at its further extremity. Here I had been seated but a
    short time when, lo, a window opposite the place where I sat was opened,
    and there looked out from it a damsel like the full moon, such as I had
    never in my life beheld. She had some flowers, which she was watering,
    beneath the window; and she looked to the right and left, and then shut
    the window, and disappeared from before me. Fire had been shot into my
    heart, and my mind was absorbed by her; my hatred of women was turned
    into love, and I continued sitting in the same place until sunset, in a
    state of distraction from the violence of my passion, when, lo, the
    Ḳáḍee of the city came riding along, with slaves before him and servants
    behind him, and alighted, and entered the house from which the damsel
    had looked out: so I knew that he must be her father.

    I then returned to my house, sorrowful; and fell upon my bed, full of
    anxious thoughts; and my female slaves came in to me, and seated
    themselves around me, not knowing what was the matter with me; and I
    acquainted them not with my case, nor returned any answers to their
    questions; and my disorder increased. The neighbours, therefore, came
    to cheer me with their visits; and among those who visited me was an old
    woman, who, as soon as she saw me, discovered my state; whereupon she
    seated herself at my head, and, addressing me in a kind manner, said, O
    my son, tell me what hath happened to thee? So I related to her my
    story, and she said, O my son, this is the daughter of the Ḳáḍee of
    Baghdád, and she is kept in close confinement: the place where thou
    sawest her is her apartment, and her father occupies a large saloon
    below, leaving her alone; and often do I visit her: thou canst obtain an
    interview with her only through me: so brace up thy nerves. When I
    heard, therefore, what she said, I took courage, and fortified my heart;
    and my family rejoiced that day. I rose up firm in limb, and hoping for
    complete restoration; and the old woman departed; but she returned with
    her countenance changed, and said, O my son, ask not what she did when I
    told her of thy case; for she said, If thou abstain not, O ill-omened
    old woman, from this discourse, I will treat thee as thou
    deservest:--but I must go to her a second time.

    [Illustration]

    On hearing this, my disorder increased: after some days, however, the
    old woman came again, and said, O my son, I desire of thee a reward for
    good tidings. My soul returned to my body at these words, and I replied,
    Thou shalt receive from me everything that thou canst wish. She then
    said, I went yesterday to the damsel, and when she beheld me with broken
    heart and weeping eye, she said to me, O my aunt, wherefore do I see
    thee with contracted heart?--and when she had thus said, I wept, and
    answered, O my daughter and mistress, I came to thee yesterday from
    visiting a youth who loveth thee, and he is at the point of death on thy
    account:--and, her heart being moved with compassion, she asked, Who is
    this youth of whom thou speakest? I answered, He is my son, and the
    child that is dear to my soul: he saw thee at the window some days ago,
    while thou wast watering thy flowers; and when he beheld thy face, he
    became distracted with love for thee: I informed him of the conversation
    that I had with thee the first time; upon which his disorder increased,
    and he took to his pillow: he is now dying, and there is no doubt of his
    fate.--And upon this, her countenance became pale, and she said, Is this
    all on my account?--Yea, by Allah, I answered; and what dost thou order
    me to do?--Go to him, said she; convey to him my salutation, and tell
    him that my love is greater than his; and on Friday next, before the
    congregational prayers, let him come hither: I will give orders to open
    the door to him, and to bring him up to me, and I will have a short
    interview with him, and he shall return before my father comes back from
    the prayers.

    When I heard these words of the old woman, the anguish which I had
    suffered ceased; my heart was set at rest, and I gave her the suit of
    clothes which I was then wearing, and she departed, saying to me, Cheer
    up thy heart. I replied, I have no longer any pain. The people of my
    house, and my friends, communicated, one to another, the good news of my
    restoration to health, and I remained thus until the Friday, when the
    old woman came in to me, and asked me respecting my state: so I informed
    her that I was happy and well. I then dressed and perfumed myself, and
    sat waiting for the people to go to prayers, that I might repair to the
    damsel; but the old woman said to me, Thou hast yet more than ample
    time, and if thou go to the bath and shave, especially for the sake of
    obliterating the traces of thy disorder, it will be more becoming.--It
    is a judicious piece of advice, replied I; but I will shave my head
    first, and then go into the bath.

    [Illustration]

    So I sent for a barber to shave my head, saying to the boy, Go to the
    market, and bring me a barber, one who is a man of sense, little
    inclined to impertinence, that he may not make my head ache by his
    chattering. And the boy went, and brought this sheykh, who, on entering,
    saluted me; and when I had returned his salutation, he said to me, May
    God dispel thy grief and thine anxiety, and misfortunes and sorrows! I
    responded, May God accept thy prayer! He then said, Be cheerful, O my
    master, for health hath returned to thee. Dost thou desire to be shaved
    or to be bled?--for it hath been handed down, on the authority of
    Ibn-'Abbás,[V_56] that the Prophet said, Whoso shorteneth his hair
    on Friday, God will avert from him seventy diseases;--and it hath been
    handed down also, on the same authority, that the Prophet said, Whoso is
    cupped on Friday will not be secure from the loss of sight and from
    frequent disease.--Abstain, said I, from this useless discourse, and
    come immediately, shave my head, for I am weak. And he arose, and,
    stretching forth his hand, took out a handkerchief, and opened it; and
    lo, there was in it an astrolabe, consisting of seven plates;[V_57]
    and he took it, and went into the middle of the court, where he raised
    his head towards the sun, and looked for a considerable time; after
    which he said to me, Know that there have passed, of this our day, which
    is Friday, and which is the tenth of Ṣafar,[V_58] of the year
    263[V_59] of the Flight of the Prophet,--upon whom be the most
    excellent of blessings and peace!--and the ascendant star of which,
    according to the required rules of the science of computation, is the
    planet Mars,--seven degrees[V_60] and six minutes; and it happeneth
    that Mercury hath come in conjunction with that planet; and this
    indicateth that the shaving of hair is now a most excellent operation:
    and it hath indicated to me, also, that thou desirest to confer a
    benefit upon a person: and fortunate is he!--but after that, there is an
    announcement that presenteth itself to me respecting a matter which I
    will not mention to thee.

    By Allah, I exclaimed, thou hast wearied me, and dissipated my mind, and
    augured against me, when I required thee only to shave my head: arise,
    then, and shave it; and prolong not thy discourse to me. But he replied,
    By Allah, if thou knewest the truth of the case, thou wouldst demand of
    me a further explication; and I counsel thee to do this day as I direct
    thee, according to the calculations deduced from the stars: it is thy
    duty to praise God, and not to oppose me; for I am one who giveth thee
    good advice, and who regardeth thee with compassion: I would that I were
    in thy service for a whole year, that thou mightest do me justice; and I
    desire not any pay from thee for so doing.--When I heard this, I said to
    him, Verily thou art killing me this day, and there is no escape for
    me.--O my master, he replied, I am he whom the people call
    Eṣ-Ṣámit,[V_61] on account of the paucity of my speech, by which I
    am distinguished above my brothers; for my eldest brother is named
    El-Baḳbooḳ;[V_62] and the second, El-Heddár; and the third, Baḳbaḳ;
    and the fourth is named El-Kooz el-Aṣwánee; and the fifth, El-Feshshár;
    and the sixth is named Shaḳáliḳ; and the seventh brother is named
    Eṣ-Ṣámit; and he is myself.

    Now when this barber thus overwhelmed me with his talk, I felt as if my
    gall-bladder had burst, and said to the boy, Give him a quarter of a
    piece of gold, and let him depart from me for the sake of Allah: for I
    have no need to shave my head. But the barber on hearing what I said to
    the boy, exclaimed, What is this that thou hast said, O my lord? By
    Allah, I will accept from thee no pay unless I serve thee; and serve
    thee I must; for to do so is incumbent on me, and to perform what thou
    requirest; and I care not if I receive from thee no money. If thou
    knowest not my worth, I know thine; and thy father--may Allah have mercy
    upon him!--treated us with beneficence; for he was a man of generosity.
    By Allah, thy father sent for me one day, like this blessed day, and
    when I went to him, he had a number of his friends with him, and he said
    to me, Take some blood from me. So I took the astrolabe, and observed
    the altitude for him, and found the ascendant of the hour to be of evil
    omen, and that the letting of blood would be attended with trouble: I
    therefore acquainted him with this, and he conformed to my wish, and
    waited until the arrival of the approved hour, when I took the blood
    from him. He did not oppose me; but, on the contrary, thanked me; and in
    like manner all the company present thanked me; and thy father gave me
    a hundred pieces of gold for services similar to the letting of
    blood.--May God, said I, shew no mercy to my father for knowing such a
    man as thou!--and the barber laughed, and exclaimed, There is no deity
    but God! Moḥammad is God's Apostle! Extolled be the perfection of Him
    who changeth others, but is not changed! I did not imagine thee to be
    otherwise than a man of sense; but thou hast talked nonsense in
    consequence of thine illness. God hath mentioned, in his Excellent Book,
    those who restrain their anger, and who forgive men:[V_63]--but
    thou art excused in every case. I am unacquainted, however, with the
    cause of thy haste; and thou knowest that thy father used to do nothing
    without consulting me; and it hath been said, that the person to whom
    one applies for advice should be trusted: now thou wilt find no one
    better acquainted with the affairs of the world than myself, and I am
    standing on my feet to serve thee. I am not displeased with thee, and
    how then art thou displeased with me? But I will have patience with thee
    on account of the favours which I have received from thy father.--By
    Allah, said I, thou hast wearied me with thy discourse, and overcome me
    with thy speech! I desire that thou shave my head and depart from me.

    I gave vent to my rage; and would have risen, even if he had wetted my
    head, when he said, I knew that displeasure with me had overcome thee;
    but I will not be angry with thee, for thy sense is weak, and thou art a
    youth: a short time ago I used to carry thee on my shoulder,[V_64]
    and take thee to the school.--Upon this, I said to him, O my brother, I
    conjure thee by Allah, depart from me that I may perform my business,
    and go thou thy way. Then I rent my clothes; and when he saw me do this,
    he took the razor, and sharpened it, and continued to do so until my
    soul almost parted from my body; then advancing to my head, he shaved a
    small portion of it; after which he raised his hand, and said, O my
    lord, haste is from the Devil;--and he repeated this couplet:--

      Deliberate, and haste not to accomplish thy desire; and be merciful,
        so shalt thou meet with one merciful:
      For there is no hand but God's hand is above it;[V_65] nor
        oppressor that shall not meet with an oppressor.

    O my lord (he then continued), I do not imagine that thou knowest my
    condition in society; for my hand lighteth upon the heads of kings and
    emeers and wezeers and sages and learned men; and of such a one as
    myself hath the poet said,--

      The trades altogether are like a necklace, and this barber is
        the chief pearl of the strings.
      He excelleth all that are endowed with skill, and under his hands
        are the heads of Kings.

    --Leave, said I, that which doth not concern thee! Thou hast contracted
    my heart, and troubled my mind.--I fancy that thou art in haste, he
    rejoined. I replied, Yes! Yes! Yes!--Proceed slowly, said he; for verily
    haste is from the Devil, and it giveth occasion to repentance and
    disappointment; and he upon whom be blessing and peace[V_65] hath
    said, The best of affairs is that which is commenced with
    deliberation:--and, by Allah, I am in doubt as to thine affair: I wish,
    therefore, that thou wouldst make known to me what thou art hasting to
    do; and may it be good; for I fear it is otherwise.

    There now remained, to the appointed time, three hours; and he threw the
    razor from his hand in anger, and, taking the astrolabe, went again to
    observe the sun; then after he had waited a long time, he returned,
    saying, There remain, to the hour of prayer, three hours, neither more
    nor less. For the sake of Allah, said I, be silent; for thou hast
    crumbled my liver!--and thereupon, he took the razor, and sharpened it
    as he had done the first time, and shaved another portion of my head.
    Then stopping again, he said, I am in anxiety on account of thy hurry:
    if thou wouldst acquaint me with the cause of it, it would be better for
    thee; for thou knowest that thy father used to do nothing without
    consulting me.

    I perceived now that I could not avoid his importunity, and said within
    myself, The time of prayer is almost come, and I desire to go before the
    people come out from the service: if I delay a little longer, I know not
    how to gain admission to her. I therefore said to him, Be quick, and
    cease from this chattering and impertinence; for I desire to repair to
    an entertainment with my friends. But when he heard the mention of the
    entertainment, he exclaimed, The day is a blessed day for me! I
    yesterday conjured a party of my intimate friends to come and feast with
    me, and forgot to prepare for them anything to eat; and now I have
    remembered it. Alas for the disgrace that I shall experience from
    them!--So I said to him, Be in no anxiety on this account, since thou
    hast been told that I am going to-day to an entertainment; for all the
    food and drink that is in my house shall be thine if thou use expedition
    in my affair, and quickly finish shaving my head.--May God recompense
    thee with every blessing! he replied: describe to me what thou hast for
    my guests, that I may know it. I have, said I, five dishes of meat, and
    ten fowls fricandoed, and a roasted lamb.--Cause them to be brought
    before me, he said, that I may see them. So I had them brought to him,
    and he exclaimed, Divinely art thou gifted! How generous is thy soul!
    But the incense and perfumes are wanting.--I brought him, therefore, a
    box containing nedd[V_67] and aloes-wood and ambergris and musk,
    worth fifty pieces of gold.--The time had now become contracted, like my
    own heart; so I said to him, Receive this, and shave the whole of my
    head, by the existence of Moḥammad, God bless and save him! But he
    replied, By Allah, I will not take it until I see all that it
    contains.--I therefore ordered the boy, and he opened the box to him;
    whereupon the barber threw down the astrolabe from his hand, and,
    seating himself upon the ground, turned over the perfumes and incense
    and aloes-wood in the box until my soul almost quitted my body.

    [Illustration]

    He then advanced, and took the razor, and shaved another small portion
    of my head; after which he said, By Allah, O my son, I know not whether
    I should thank thee or thank thy father; for my entertainment to-day is
    entirely derived from thy bounty and kindness, and I have no one among
    my visiters deserving of it; for my guests are, Zeytoon the bath-keeper,
    and Ṣaleeạ the wheat-seller, and 'Owkal the bean-seller, and 'Akresheh
    the grocer, and Ḥomeyd the dustman, and 'Akárish the milk-seller, and
    each of these hath a peculiar dance which he performeth, and peculiar
    verses which he reciteth; and the best of their qualities is, that they
    are like thy servant, the memlook who is before thee; and I, thy slave,
    know neither loquacity nor impertinence. As to the bath-keeper, he
    saith, If I go not to the feast, it cometh to my house!--and as to the
    dustman, he is witty, and full of frolick: often doth he dance, and say,
    News, with my wife, is not kept in a chest!--and each of my friends hath
    jests that another hath not: but the description is not like the actual
    observation. If thou choose, therefore, to come to us, it will be more
    pleasant both to thee and to us: relinquish, then, thy visit to thy
    friends of whom thou hast told us that thou desirest to go to them; for
    the traces of disease are yet upon thee, and probably thou art going to
    a people of many words, who will talk of that which concerneth them not;
    or probably there will be among them one impertinent person; and thy
    soul is already disquieted by disease.--I replied, If it be the will of
    God, that shall be on some other day:--but he said, It will be more
    proper that thou first join my party of friends, that thou mayest enjoy
    their conviviality, and delight thyself with their salt. Act in
    accordance with the saying of the poet:--

      Defer not a pleasure when it can be had; for fortune often destroyeth
        our plans.

    Upon this I laughed from a heart laden with anger, and said to him, Do
    what I require, that I may go in the care of God, whose name be exalted!
    and do thou go to thy friends, for they are waiting thine arrival. He
    replied, I desire nothing but to introduce thee into the society of
    these people; for verily they are of the sons of that class among which
    is no impertinent person; and if thou didst but behold them once, thou
    wouldst leave all thine own companions.--May God, said I, give thee
    abundant joy with them, and I must bring them together here some
    day.--If that be thy wish, he rejoined, and thou wilt first attend the
    entertainment of thy friends this day, wait until I take this present
    with which thou hast honoured me, and place it before my friends, that
    they may eat and drink without waiting for me, and then I will return to
    thee, and go with thee to thy companions; for there is no false delicacy
    between me and my companions that should prevent my leaving them: so I
    will return to thee quickly, and repair with thee whithersoever thou
    goest.--Upon this I exclaimed, There is no strength nor power but in
    God, the High, the Great! Go thou to thy companions, and delight thy
    heart with them, and leave me to repair to mine, and to remain with them
    this day, for they are waiting my arrival.--But he said, I will not
    leave thee to go alone.--The place to which I am going, said I, none can
    enter except myself.--I suppose then, he rejoined, that thou hast an
    appointment to-day with some female: otherwise, thou wouldst take me
    with thee; for I am more deserving than all other men, and will assist
    thee to attain what thou desirest. I fear that thou art going to visit
    some strange woman, and that thy life will be lost; for in this city of
    Baghdád no one can do anything of this kind, especially on such a day
    as this; seeing that the Wálee of Baghdád is a terrible, sharp
    sword.--Wo to thee, O wicked old man! I exclaimed, what are these words
    with which thou addressest me?--And upon this, he kept a long silence.

    The time of prayer had now arrived, and the time of the
    Khuṭbeh[V_68] was near, when he had finished shaving my head: so I
    said to him, Go with this food and drink to thy friends, and I will wait
    for thee until thou return, and thou shalt accompany me:--and I
    continued my endeavours to deceive him, that he might go away; but he
    said to me, Verily thou art deceiving me, and wilt go alone, and
    precipitate thyself into a calamity from which there will be no escape
    for thee: by Allah! by Allah! then, quit not this spot until I return to
    thee and accompany thee, that I may know what will be the result of
    thine affair.--I replied, Well: prolong not thine absence from me. And
    he took the food and drink and other things which I had given him, but
    intrusted them to a porter to convey them to his abode, and concealed
    himself in one of the by-streets. I then immediately arose. The muëddins
    on the menárehs had chanted the Selám of Friday;[V_69] and I put on
    my clothes, and went forth alone, and, arriving at the by-street,
    stopped at the door of the house where I had seen the damsel: and lo,
    the barber was behind me, and I knew it not. I found the door open, and
    entered; and immediately the master of the house returned from the
    prayers, and entered the saloon, and closed the door; and I said within
    myself, How did this devil discover me?

    Now it happened, just at this time, for the fulfilment of God's purpose
    to rend the veil of protection before me, that a female slave belonging
    to the master of the house committed some offence, in consequence of
    which he beat her, and she cried out; whereupon a male slave came in to
    him to liberate her; but he beat him also, and he likewise cried out;
    and the barber concluded that he was beating me; so he cried, and rent
    his clothes, and sprinkled dust upon his head, shrieking, and calling
    for assistance. He was surrounded by people, and said to them, My master
    hath been killed in the house of the Ḳáḍee! Then running to my house,
    crying out all the while, and with a crowd behind him, he gave the news
    to my family; and I knew not what he had done when they approached,
    crying, Alas for our master!--the barber all the while being before
    them, with his clothes rent, and a number of the people of the city with
    them. They continued shrieking, the barber shrieking at their head, and
    all of them exclaiming, Alas for our slain!--Thus they advanced to the
    house in which I was confined; and when the Ḳáḍee heard of this
    occurrence, the event troubled him, and he arose, and opened the door,
    and seeing a great crowd, he was confounded, and said, O people, what is
    the news? The servants replied, Thou hast killed our master.--O people,
    rejoined he, what hath your master done unto me that I should kill him;
    and wherefore do I see this barber before you?--Thou hast just now
    beaten him with miḳra'ahs, said the barber; and I heard his cries.--What
    hath he done that I should kill him? repeated the Ḳáḍee. And whence, he
    added, came he; and whither would he go?--Be not an old man of
    malevolence, exclaimed the barber; for I know the story, and the reason
    of his entering thy house, and the truth of the whole affair: thy
    daughter is in love with him, and he is in love with her; and thou hast
    discovered that he had entered thy house, and hast ordered thy young
    men, and they have beaten him. By Allah, none shall decide between us
    and thee except the Khaleefeh; or thou shalt bring forth to us our
    master that his family may take him; and oblige me not to enter and take
    him forth from you: haste then thyself to produce him.

    [Illustration]

    Upon this, the Ḳáḍee was withheld from speaking, and became utterly
    abashed before the people: but presently he said to the barber, If thou
    speak truth, enter thyself, and bring him forth. So the barber advanced,
    and entered the house; and when I saw him do so, I sought for a way to
    escape; but I found no place of refuge except a large chest which I
    observed in the same apartment in which I then was: I therefore entered
    this, and shut down the lid, and held in my breath. Immediately after,
    the barber ran into the saloon, and, without looking in any other
    direction than that in which I had concealed myself, came thither: then
    turning his eyes to the right and left, and seeing nothing but the
    chest, he raised it upon his head; whereupon my reason forsook me. He
    quickly descended with it; and I, being now certain that he would not
    quit me, opened the chest, and threw myself upon the ground. My leg was
    broken by the fall; and when I came to the door of the house, I found a
    multitude of people: I had never seen such a crowd as was there
    collected on that day; so I began to scatter gold among them, to divert
    them; and while they were busied in picking it up, I hastened through
    the by-streets of Baghdád, followed by this barber; and wherever I
    entered, he entered after me, crying, They would have plunged me into
    affliction on account of my master! Praise be to God who aided me
    against them, and delivered my master from their hands! Thou
    continuedst, O my master, to be excited by haste for the accomplishment
    of thine evil design until thou broughtest upon thyself this event; and
    if God had not blessed thee with me, thou hadst not escaped from this
    calamity into which thou hast fallen; and they might have involved thee
    in a calamity from which thou wouldst never have escaped. Beg,
    therefore, of God, that I may live for thy sake, to liberate thee in
    future. By Allah, thou hast almost destroyed me by thine evil design,
    desiring to go alone: but we will not be angry with thee for thine
    ignorance, for thou art endowed with little sense, and of a hasty
    disposition.--Art thou not satisfied, replied I, with that which thou
    hast done, but wilt thou run after me through the market-streets?--And I
    desired for death to liberate me from him; but found it not; and in the
    excess of my rage I ran from him, and, entering a shop in the midst of
    the market, implored the protection of its owner; and he drove away the
    barber from me.

    I then seated myself in a magazine belonging to him, and said within
    myself, I cannot now rid myself of this barber; but he will be with me
    night and day, and I cannot endure the sight of his face. So I
    immediately summoned witnesses, and wrote a document, dividing my
    property among my family, and appointing a guardian over them, and I
    ordered him to sell the house and all the immoveable possessions,
    charging him with the care of the old and young, and set forth at once
    on a journey in order to escape from this wretch. I then arrived in your
    country, where I took up my abode, and have remained a considerable
    time; and when ye invited me, and I came unto you, I saw this vile
    wretch among you, seated at the upper end of the room. How, then, can my
    heart be at ease, or my sitting in your company be pleasant to me, with
    this fellow, who hath brought these events upon me, and been the cause
    of the breaking of my leg?

    The young man still persevered in his refusal to remain with us; and
    when we had heard his story, we said to the barber, Is this true which
    the young man hath said of thee?--By Allah, he answered, it was through
    my intelligence that I acted thus towards him; and had I not done so, he
    had perished: myself only was the cause of his escape; and it was
    through the goodness of God, by my means, that he was afflicted by the
    breaking of his leg instead of being punished by the loss of his life.
    Were I a person of many words, I had not done him this kindness; and now
    I will relate to you an event that happened to me, that ye may believe
    me to be a man of few words, and less of an impertinent than my
    brothers; and it was this:--



    The tailor then proceeded thus:--When we heard the story of the barber,
    and were convinced of his impertinence and loquacity, and that the young
    man had been treated unjustly by him, we seized hold upon him, and put
    him in confinement, and, seating ourselves to keep watch over him, ate
    and drank; and the feast was finished in the most agreeable manner. We
    remained sitting together until the call to afternoon-prayers, when I
    went forth, and returned to my house; but my wife looked angrily at me,
    and said, Thou hast been all the day enjoying thy pleasure while I have
    been sitting at home sorrowful; now if thou go not forth with me and
    amuse me for the remainder of the day, thy refusal will be the cause of
    my separation from thee. So I took her and went out with her, and we
    amused ourselves until nightfall, when, returning home, we met this
    humpback, full of drink, and repeating verses; upon which I invited him
    to come home with us, and he consented. I then went forth to buy some
    fried fish, and having bought it and returned, we sat down to eat; and
    my wife took a morsel of bread and a piece of fish, and put them into
    his mouth, and choked him, so that he died; whereupon I took him up, and
    contrived to throw him into the house of this physician, and he
    contrived to throw him into the house of the steward, and the steward
    contrived to throw him in the way of the broker.--This is the story of
    what happened to me yesterday. Is it not more wonderful than that of the
    humpback?
